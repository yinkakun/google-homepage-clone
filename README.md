# Google Homepage Clone

Clone of Google homepage built with NextJS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS for a React Frontend Developer technical assesment.

<br />

## Instructions

- Re-create https://google.com search homepage using React.

- Upload your code with instructions on how to run it to [Github](https://github.com).

- Ensure your implementation is responsive enough i.e. it should look code on desktop and phones.

- Clicking on the 'Google Search' button should redirect to `[https://google.com/search?q={users](https://google.com/search?q={users)-text-here}`. `{users-text-here}` should be the value entered in the search input field.

- Clicking the 'I'm Feeling Lucky' button should redirect to https://perfects.engineering.

- You are free to add or not add any other functionality you deem fit.

- Using Nextjs and Tailwind CSS in your implementation is a huge plus.
